# AGENTS

## Conversation Handshake (Always On)

- For direct user instructions, first send a short restatement:
  - what the user asked
  - what you will do immediately
- Then execute without waiting unless user explicitly asks to pause.
- If user gives correction/steer feedback, switch direction immediately.

## Trigger Accuracy Rule (Always On)

- Skill triggering uses **union matching**: trigger when **any** of these match:
  - user wording / command intent
  - touched logic carrier
  - touched file area
  - known symptom pattern
- Do not narrow trigger scope below prior behavior.
- If multiple skills match, use all relevant skills together.
- Exclusion notes (for example “pure copy/styling/logging/tests only”) apply only when you can confirm logic carriers are unchanged.

## Issue Gate Rule (Always On)

When any GitHub issue number or URL appears in the conversation:

- Do **not** start code assessment or implementation directly.
- First enter the issue workflow via `prepare`: read the issue, classify as `tiny` / `medium` / `large`, verify current state against the live codebase, and decide the execution path.
- A `tiny` fix that can be finished immediately is the only exception that skips formal `prepare`.
- For medium/large issues: shape the issue before implementation, record an execution snapshot in the issue body, and follow `lint` / `finish` entry points.
- Never conflate "product decision received" with "ready to implement" — first complete the prepare pass, then proceed.
- If the issue carries `status:needs-clarification` or equivalent, surface the decision question before shaping or implementation.
- This rule applies regardless of whether the user explicitly says "按流程" — issue numbers and URLs are the trigger.

## Workspace Cleanliness Rule (Always On)

For every new repository task in chat (not only GitHub issue workflow):

- Do **not** start any substantive read/edit/build work before checking workspace cleanliness.
- Check current workspace cleanliness with `git status --short`.
- If the worktree is clean, proceed normally.
- If the worktree is not clean, do not silently continue with mixed context:
  - first classify existing local changes as either `same-task` or `different-task`
  - if `different-task`, stop and ask the user whether to:
    - commit/push them first
    - shelve them
    - or explicitly continue in dirty workspace
  - if `same-task`, explicitly state that assumption in chat and continue
- Do not mix unrelated edits into one commit by default.
- When the user asks to "先提交" or similar, complete that commit before starting additional implementation work.

## Root-Cause First Bugfix Rule (Always On)

For any bug, regression, flaky behavior, test failure, unexpected behavior, or suspected design mistake:

- Default objective is to identify and fix the root cause or wrong design boundary, not merely to hide the visible symptom.
- Do **not** start with the smallest patch, extra guard, fallback, retry, null-check, copy tweak, or conditional bypass just because it makes the symptom disappear.
- Symptom-only or containment-only fixes are **forbidden by default**. They are allowed only when the user explicitly approves that tradeoff in the current turn.
- Before proposing or implementing a fix, first gather concrete runtime evidence, trace the failing path across component boundaries, and state the current root-cause hypothesis.
- If the root cause is still unknown, continue investigation instead of converting uncertainty into a patch.
- If the failure is caused by a wrong abstraction, ownership split, state machine, data shape, or protocol boundary, prefer the deeper corrective fix even when it is broader than the smallest diff.
- Do not preserve a known-wrong design by layering compatibility shims or defensive patches on top unless the user explicitly asks for a temporary containment path.
- If a true emergency hotfix is needed before root-cause work is complete, label it explicitly as temporary containment, explain what remains unproven, state the residual risk, and wait for explicit user approval before applying it.
- Do not present symptom suppression as a completed fix. State exactly what was proven, what remains uncertain, and what deeper correction is still required.

## Deterministic Repo Helper Rule

- For repeated tail-state or publish-state checks, prefer `bash scripts/dev/worktree-facts.sh` instead of manually rerunning `git status --short --branch`.
- Before opening a guessed repo path, prefer `bash scripts/dev/resolve-repo-path.sh <path>` or `rg --files` so path probes do not fail by typo.
- Before using unfamiliar `gh ... --json` fields, prefer `bash scripts/dev/gh-json-fields.sh <gh-subcommand...>` and `--check ...` when needed.
- Do not rerun an identical deterministic failure unless some input, state, or environment has changed; first state what changed.

## Staged Execution Continuity Rule

When the user explicitly asks staged rollout (for example: `按阶段推进`, `分阶段推进`, `阶段式推进`, `staged rollout`):

- Treat it as continuous execution by default.
- Complete all planned stages in one flow unless a real blocker appears.
- Do not pause after one stage to ask whether to continue.
- Treat a phase or stage as execution order only, not as a normal stopping boundary.
- For unsplit issue work, finishing `阶段 A / B / C` is never by itself a valid reason to stop.
- At the end of every phase, explicitly re-check:
  - is the issue already fully complete?
  - is there a hard blocker or real contradiction?
  - did execution hit a product decision gate?
  - does the issue now need a formal split before continuing?
- If all answers above are no, continue immediately into the next phase instead of stopping at the phase boundary.
- For repository or issue work, do not treat “local implementation is done” as a valid stopping point by itself.
- The staged flow is only complete when the normal tail work is also done for that task:
  - validation finished
  - required docs / issue state synced
  - commit completed when the change is worth keeping
  - push completed when repo policy says it should be pushed
  - issue closed when the issue is actually finished
- Valid stop conditions:
  - hard blocker (dependency/outage/permission)
  - newly discovered contradiction that makes continuing unsafe
  - explicit user redirection
- On stop, report blocker evidence and exact resume action.

## Skill Trigger Matrix

### `systematic-debugging`

Use `superpowers:systematic-debugging` when working on:

- any bug, regression, flaky behavior, test failure, unexpected behavior, build failure, or performance anomaly
- any request phrased as `debug`, `排查`, `看下为什么`, `修 bug`, `fix bug`, `why is this happening`, or similar
- any situation where a quick patch, fallback, or smallest-diff fix feels tempting
- any repeated failure where the previous fix did not fully explain the behavior

Execution floor:

- finish root-cause investigation before proposing or implementing a fix
- do not use minimal symptom-suppression patches unless the user explicitly approves that path in the current turn
- if evidence points to a design/ownership/boundary problem, escalate to that deeper fix instead of cosmetically patching the symptom
- if 3 fix attempts fail, stop local patching and question the architecture explicitly before continuing

### `relay-stack-playbook`

Use `.codex/skills/relay-stack-playbook/` when working on:

- `relayd` / `relay-wrapper`
- Feishu bot inbound/outbound behavior
- VS Code remote integration
- Codex app-server protocol translation
- `/list`, `/attach`, `/use`, `/stop`
- queue/dispatch/thread routing/surface session issues
- helper/internal traffic classification issues
- “VS Code 有回复但飞书没回复” and similar missing-reply symptoms

### `remote-state-machine-guardrail`

Use `.codex/skills/remote-state-machine-guardrail/` for remote-surface state-machine logic carriers:

- attach/detach, `/use`, `/follow`, `/new` state predicates or transitions
- selected-thread / attached-instance / input-routing decisions
- queue routing / dispatch mode / pause-handoff gating
- headless launch/resume/cancel/timeout/recovery progression
- request-capture / prompt-gate / modal-gate / staged-input / selection-flow enter-exit
- command-availability matrix
- any change that adds/removes remote surface states

Do not trigger only for pure copy/styling/logging/tests/refactor with no logic-carrier change.

### `feishu-ui-state-machine-guardrail`

Use `.codex/skills/feishu-ui-state-machine-guardrail/` for Feishu card UI state-machine logic carriers:

- callback payload schema/parsing
- card owner/kind/action routing
- inline replace vs append-only decision
- command menu / selection prompt / request prompt navigation
- `daemon_lifecycle_id`, old-card rejection, freshness/lifecycle stamping
- projector/gateway decisions on whether an existing card can still mutate state

Do not trigger only for pure copy/styling/logging/tests/refactor with no logic-carrier change.

### `issue-workflow-guardrail`

Use `.codex/skills/issue-workflow-guardrail/` when task is centered on a GitHub issue:

- issue number or issue URL appears
- raw issue needs shaping before execution
- user asks to handle/complete/triage/refresh/close an issue
- need parent/child issue split, schedule table, or staged orchestration
- need result roll-up or next ready unit selection
- need implementable-now reassessment / blocked-state update
- need issue label/body/comment refinement

Mode override phrases:

- force `fast`: `workflow:fast`, `fast path`, `快速处理`, `简化流程`
- force `full`: `workflow:full`, `full path`, `完整流程`, `标准 issue workflow`

### `issue-verifier`

Use `.codex/skills/issue-verifier/` when issue work needs an independent validation pass:

- `验收`
- `独立验证`
- `对齐验证`
- `完成前复核`
- medium/large issue is otherwise ready to close and needs a read-only acceptance check

If the issue is still shaping, still missing execution closure, or still actively being implemented, stay on `issue-workflow-guardrail` first.

### `local-upgrade`

Use `.codex/skills/local-upgrade/` for repository-local daemon upgrade/debug routing:

- `本地升级`
- `upgrade-local.sh`
- pull latest + rebuild + upgrade local daemon
- local-upgrade transaction from repo build
- without explicit user approval in the current turn, do not auto-run repository-local upgrade flows

Natural-language repo requests split by target semantics:

- `本地升级` and other repo-build upgrade requests are **repo tasks**:
  - use `./upgrade-local.sh`
  - when the user names a target instance, pass `--instance` and keep that target explicit
- `升级当前 daemon 自身`, `把我现在这个实例升上去`, `恢复当前实例到支持 dev 的版本` use `./upgrade-self.sh`
- `debug 一下`, `看下当前实例状态`, `查日志`, `报个 bug` default to the **current daemon self target**, not the repo-bound target
- for explicit current self-target HTTP inspection, prefer `bash scripts/install/self-target-request.sh ...`
- only use `bash scripts/install/repo-target-request.sh ...` or `bash scripts/install/repo-install-target.sh --format shell` when the user explicitly asks for:
  - the repo-bound target
  - or a named install target such as `stable` / `beta` / `master`
- do not silently reinterpret a current-instance debug request as a repo-bound debug request
- do not satisfy those natural-language requests by sending daemon slash commands unless the user explicitly asked for the slash-command path

Explicit slash commands (`/upgrade`, `/upgrade local`, `/upgrade latest`, `/debug`) stay as daemon-direct actions.

### `safe-push`

Use `.codex/skills/safe-push/` when pushing committed changes:

- user says `推送` / `push` / `提交并推送`
- `git push` rejected because remote advanced
- user asks fetch/rebase/retest/push flow

**Always use `./safe-push.sh` to push committed changes.** Do not push with plain `git push`.

When safe-push rebases and shows the rebase review gate:

- The gate message will look like: `rebase review required (non-interactive shell)`
- The gate blocks push until the rebased diff has been explicitly reviewed and confirmed.
- The required action is: `./safe-push.sh --confirm-rebase-review`
- Do **not** bypass this gate with `--no-verify` or other flags.
- Confirm after reviewing the rebase log and verifying that no unrelated commits were pulled in.

### `issue-doc-sync`

Use `.codex/skills/issue-doc-sync/` when syncing closed GitHub issues back into `docs/`.

### `build-page-mock`

Use `.codex/skills/build-page-mock/` when working on:

- `页面 Mock`
- 浏览器可运行的页面原型 / interactive demo
- 从已确认 mock 落最终产品页面
- `按 mock 落产品` / `从 mock 生成页面` / `按原型实现最终页面`
- `docs/draft/*mock*.html`
- `web/src/**` 或 `internal/app/daemon/adminui/**` 下新增的 mock / preview 页面
- 需要用假数据覆盖真实交互的用户可见页面预览

Execution floor:

- before writing visible page content, define the page's visible-content contract:
  - final user
  - current task
  - allowed information types
  - disallowed information types
  - allowed feedback slots
- before delivery, audit every visible string and sample value against that contract
- if a visible element cannot be clearly justified for the final user's current task, remove it
- sample data is not exempt; code, repo paths, internal names, protocol fields, and design notes are disallowed on non-technical user pages by default

## Web Design Baseline

When modifying any file in the trigger area below, do **not** merge until the page satisfies every baseline requirement listed. Violating any single requirement is a merge-blocker.

For web page design/layout/copy/interaction changes, follow:

- `docs/general/web-design-guidelines.md`
- `docs/general/page-mock-guidelines.md` when the task includes page mocks or browser-runnable prototypes

Trigger area:

- `web/src/**`
- `internal/app/daemon/adminui/**`
- setup/admin/install/onboarding/status page redesign
- any change that adds/removes user-visible sections, steps, cards, or default-exposed technical details

Baseline requirements:

- desktop + mobile both work
- copy is user-facing, not architecture-facing
- avoid long dump pages; defer/fold/split lower-priority info
- do not expose internal design-purpose text to end users
- define a visible-content contract before editing and use fail-closed judgment for visible content
- if baseline rules are intentionally changed, update `docs/general/web-design-guidelines.md` in the same change

## Feishu Card Constraints Baseline

When touching Feishu card payloads, message-card patching, CardKit streaming, or card interaction pacing in the trigger area below, do **not** merge until the design has been checked against official hard limits with an explicit size budget and degradation path. Cards that silently exceed platform limits cannot ship.

For any design or implementation that touches Feishu cards, message-card patching, CardKit streaming, or card interaction pacing, consult:

- `docs/general/feishu-card-api-constraints.md`

Trigger area:

- `internal/adapter/feishu/**`
- `internal/core/orchestrator/**` when change alters Feishu-surface card payloads, update cadence, or interaction composition
- `docs/general/feishu-card-ui-state-machine.md`
- any design/doc discussing single-turn cards, live cards, approval cards, request cards, or plan/progress/final-card aggregation on Feishu

Baseline requirements:

- design against official hard limits first: card size, element count, per-message/per-card update qps, callback SLA, streaming/interaction switching
- do not assume one giant card is safe without explicit size budget and degradation path
- if a design may exceed limits, specify fallback up front: truncate, summarize, paginate, split card, or spill to text/file/link
- when relying on a numeric Feishu platform limit in code or product design, re-check the latest official docs and sync `docs/general/feishu-card-api-constraints.md` if the baseline changed

## Feishu Menu Card Baseline

When touching menu card logic in the trigger area below, do **not** merge until every new or changed menu item includes contract mapping (`keep` / `enter_owner` / `enter_terminal`), handoff behavior, and regression tests for menu handoff + inline replacement.

For any design or implementation that touches Feishu command menu cards, launcher-to-business handoff, or menu callback replace/append behavior, consult:

- `docs/general/feishu-menu-card-usage-guidelines.md`
- `docs/general/feishu-card-ui-state-machine.md`

Trigger area:

- `internal/core/control/feishu_ui_lifecycle.go`
- `internal/core/orchestrator/service_page_view.go`
- `internal/core/orchestrator/service_feishu_ui_context.go`
- `internal/core/orchestrator/service_workspace_page.go`
- `internal/app/daemon/app_ingress.go`
- menu-related Feishu callback/view docs under `docs/general/`

Baseline requirements:

- menu actions must be classified through unified frontstage contract (`keep` / `enter_owner` / `enter_terminal`)
- menu card must stay launcher-only; business execution state belongs to owner cards
- do not reintroduce submission-anchor fallback, bare command continuation fallback, or legacy menu substrate
- any new menu item must include contract mapping, handoff behavior, and regression tests for menu handoff + inline replacement

## Feishu Card Content Context Baseline

When touching card text construction in the trigger area below, do **not** merge until all dynamic text stays out of raw markdown and regression tests prove the split. When a new structured path replaces an old markdown contract, remove the old path — do not leave permanent legacy coexistence.

For any design or implementation that touches Feishu card text contracts, markdown/plain_text split, or card text render helpers, consult:

- `docs/general/feishu-card-content-context-guidelines.md`

Trigger area:

- `internal/adapter/feishu/**`
- `internal/core/control/**` when adding or changing Feishu card DTO text fields
- `internal/core/orchestrator/**`
- `internal/app/daemon/**` when constructing Feishu-facing summary/status/message/notice/catalog text
- any design/doc discussing Feishu card markdown contracts, `plain_text`, `FeishuCardTextSection`, `SummarySections`, or `renderSystemInlineTags(...)`

Baseline requirements:

- external or dynamic text must not be precomposed into raw markdown upstream
- adapter owns the final markdown/plain_text split and Feishu-specific tags
- `renderSystemInlineTags(...)` and similar helpers are local formatting helpers, not general sanitizers
- new card text defaults to structured/plain-text carriers such as `FeishuCardTextSection` and `SummarySections`
- when a new structured path replaces an old markdown contract, remove the old path instead of leaving permanent legacy/fallback coexistence
- add regression tests that prove dynamic text stays out of markdown, or explicitly justify the remaining markdown contract

## Documentation Convention

When adding, moving, or restructuring docs under `docs/`, do **not** merge until: the doc is placed in exactly one lifecycle dir, the metadata block is complete (`Type` / `Updated` / `Summary`), and links + `docs/README.md` are updated in the same change.

For lifecycle/reference docs under `docs/`:

- place docs in exactly one lifecycle dir:
  - `docs/draft/`
  - `docs/inprogress/`
  - `docs/implemented/`
  - `docs/general/`
  - `docs/obsoleted/`
- every `docs/**/*.md` starts with visible metadata block below title:
  - `Type`
  - `Updated`
  - `Summary`
- `Type` must match directory lifecycle
- obsolete docs move to `docs/obsoleted/`
- when moving docs, update links and `docs/README.md` in same change

## State-Machine Doc Sync (Pre-commit Gate)

Canonical docs:

- remote surface: `docs/general/remote-surface-state-machine.md`
- Feishu card UI: `docs/general/feishu-card-ui-state-machine.md`

When corresponding logic carriers changed, do **not** commit until: guardrail skill passes, canonical doc is synced to implemented behavior, and dead/half-dead/stale-action states are audited.

- implement + test first
- run matching guardrail skill before commit
- sync canonical doc to implemented behavior
- audit dead/half-dead/stale-action states
- if bug-grade issue found, fix + retest in same pass
- if unresolved product tradeoff remains, append to `待讨论取舍`

## GitHub Issue Workflow (Policy)

- For medium/large issue work, use issue workflow skill and its fixed `prepare/lint/finish` entry points.
- Raw issues are allowed to start rough; first shape them to at least research closure before trying to implement.
- If an issue was opened by an external reporter, do not rewrite their original issue body into the repository's internal workflow template.
- For an external reporter issue, first create a new internal execution issue; use that internal issue as the workflow-managed unit for shaping, execution snapshots, staged plans, and close-out.
- If later split is needed, split under the internal execution issue rather than turning the external reporter issue itself into the parent scheduler.
- Treat the original external reporter issue as a communication surface: keep the original description, link the internal execution issue both ways, and sync results back there by comment.
- By default, close only the internal execution issue; do not auto-close the original external reporter issue unless the user explicitly asks for that policy.
- Do not start code assessment against known-stale checkout when worktree is clean.
- Tiny fixes that can be finished immediately do not require opening/normalizing an issue.
- Before handing a subtask to a worker, make sure the active child issue is an information closure or a stable closure index for execution.
- Prefer parent issue + child issue orchestration when one issue would otherwise mix multiple goals, validation surfaces, or weakly related code areas.
- Workflow-managed active issues should carry exactly one explicit workflow status label; use `status:implementable-now` for ready-to-start work instead of encoding readiness as “no status label”.
- When an issue is implementable and not truly single-stage, keep `建议范围`, `实现参考`, `检查参考`, and `收尾参考` current in the issue body.
- For multi-stage or multi-turn issue work, keep a durable execution snapshot in the issue body or linked design doc, including at least `当前执行点`, `下一步`, `最后一致状态`, `未完成尾项`, and `恢复步骤`.
- On resume, do not continue from chat memory alone. Re-read the execution snapshot and verify it against the current code and latest issue state before acting.
- If `未完成尾项` only contains close-out work such as verifier / commit / push / finish, then `当前执行点` and `下一步` must also stay in close-out semantics; do not leave snapshot text that still points at more implementation or validation.
- For unsplit implementable issues, a recorded phase/stage is execution sequencing only; it does not create a default stop point.
- After each completed phase on an unsplit issue, explicitly decide only among:
  - issue is actually complete
  - blocked / contradiction / product gate
  - needs formal split before more coding
  - continue into the next phase now
- Do not stop merely because the current phase ended.
- When issue work uncovers a small, non-blocking, low-priority follow-up that is not worth a standalone issue, record it under a dedicated `低优先级待办` section in the active issue body instead of leaving it only in chat.
- If implementation uncovers a red inconsistency that changes goals, acceptance, dependencies, or sibling issue assumptions, stop local patching and return the result to the orchestrating issue for replanning.
- If issue work reaches a real product decision gate, do not guess. Add a dedicated `待决策` or `产品待拍板` section with the minimal decision packet, ask only for the smallest blocking decision, then resume after that decision is synced back into the issue body.
- For medium/large finished issues, default to an independent verifier pass before close-out; only skip when the user explicitly waives it or the task is explicitly `workflow:fast`.
- Before `finish --close`, run `issuectl close-plan` and fix any returned issue-side blockers instead of using the first close attempt as a probe.
- Treat a stale naked `processing` label as a recoverable lease, not a permanent lock; the default `prepare` path may reclaim it after the configured stale window, and resumed work must refresh the issue snapshot before continuing.
- If a child issue has a parent issue, do not `finish --close` it until the parent has received a durable roll-up of the child result.
- If a parent issue is being closed, make sure its total view includes child roll-up state, verifier state, and current close judgment before `finish --close`.
- If an older issue is resumed under the current workflow, do not let it enter close-out with a legacy contract; first add the missing current workflow fields that the close gate depends on.
- Before `finish`, explicitly re-check whether durable knowledge changed enough to require syncing the issue body, linked docs, state-machine docs, or repo workflow guidance.
- For issue work requested as `处理`, `完成`, or staged rollout, do not stop after local code/test completion while any of these remain unfinished without a real blocker:
  - commit
  - push
  - final `finish`
  - issue close when acceptance is satisfied
- “I already implemented it locally” is not a sufficient reason to leave an issue open or leave commits unpublished.

## Commit / Push / Branch Policy

- If repository work is resolved and verified, do not end the turn with uncommitted changes unless the user explicitly wants local-only uncommitted state.
- All pushes must go through `./safe-push.sh`; plain `git push` is not allowed.
- When safe-push rebases and blocks on the rebase review gate, review the rebase log and confirm with `./safe-push.sh --confirm-rebase-review`.
- If you intentionally commit during task work, push in the same turn by default unless user asked local-only staging.
- Do not end a repository task with local commits left unpushed unless one of these is true:
  - the user explicitly asked to keep it local-only
  - the branch is explicitly a temporary local experiment branch
  - push is genuinely blocked by conflict, failing post-rebase validation, permission, or outage
- If stopping in a local-only state, explicitly report:
  - `LOCAL-ONLY`
  - current branch
  - current `HEAD`
  - why it was not pushed
  - the exact next action needed to publish it
- Before treating a repository task as complete, re-check both:
  - `git status --short`
  - whether local `HEAD` is ahead of its upstream
- For issue work, also re-check whether the issue itself is still open only because of process tail work; if so, finish that tail work instead of stopping.
- For temporary branch/ref switches, record start ref and return on normal exit unless user explicitly says stay.

## File Length Gate Policy

- `bash scripts/check/go-file-length.sh` is mandatory; do not bypass with `--no-verify` or equivalent.
- If blocked by oversized files, perform structure-first split and keep behavior stable unless behavior change is in scope.

## Proxy / Wrapper Policy

- For local tests/debug against localhost, unset proxy env first:
  - `unset http_proxy https_proxy HTTP_PROXY HTTPS_PROXY ALL_PROXY all_proxy`
- Wrapper exception:
  - `relay-wrapper` itself should run without proxy for local relay communication
  - when launching `codex.real`, restore captured proxy env for child process

## External Command Launch Policy

- Production Go code must not call `exec.Command` or `exec.CommandContext` directly.
- Use `internal/execlaunch` for new external process creation so Windows no-console defaults stay centralized.
- If a caller needs extra `SysProcAttr`, detached, or process-group behavior, layer it on top of `execlaunch.Prepare(cmd)` instead of replacing the shared defaults.

## Debugging / Ownership Guardrails

- Stateful bugs are evidence-first: collect full-path runtime evidence before patching.
- Do not classify helper/internal traffic using thread-local/timing heuristics; use protocol correlation ids.
- Wrapper owns accurate translation + explicit annotation; product visibility policy belongs to server/orchestrator layer.
- Config migration/install writes must preserve existing credentials unless explicit destructive reset flow is defined.
- For service lifecycle ops, do not run overlapping `stop/start/restart/bootstrap` on same daemon.
